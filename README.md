Hereâ€™s a sample README file for your encryption project:

# Encryption System

## Overview
This project implements a simple encryption system using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Python. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt messages using a symmetric key.

## Features
- **AES Encryption**: Utilizes the AES algorithm in CBC mode for secure encryption.
- **Key Generation**: Generates a random 128-bit AES key.
- **Message Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypts and decrypts messages easily.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pycryptodome` library

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encryption-system.git
   cd encryption-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pycryptodome
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Encryption System**:
   Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python encryption_system.py
   ```

2. **View Output**:
   The script will generate a random AES key, display the original message, and show the encrypted and decrypted messages.

## Key Concepts
- **AES**: A symmetric encryption algorithm that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
- **CBC Mode**: Cipher Block Chaining mode, which enhances security by combining each plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block.

## Future Enhancements
- **User Input**: Allow users to input custom messages and keys.
- **File Encryption**: Implement functionality to encrypt and decrypt files.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Develop a GUI for easier interaction.
